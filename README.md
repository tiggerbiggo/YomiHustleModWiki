# Contributing

This repository is a Github Pages project, as of right now it has no real structure. I'm looking for templates that will let me make a wiki styled site without a server backend, but for now i'm going to just be making these as basic HTML pages.

If you want to make a PR to add information of your own, feel free! This is intended as a community project so i'll definitely merge your PR if you make it and it adds something informative about modding.
